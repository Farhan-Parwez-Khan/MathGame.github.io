# ***Math Game***
## Game's introduction
My name is **Farhan Parwez Khan** and I have made a simple game using ***Python***. In this code i have used modules like *Random* and *Time*.
It is a simple game in which you have to answer as many arithmetic questions as you can in 10 sec.
Here is the code behind:
'''import random

import time

f=time.time()

count=0

while 1:

a=random.randint(0, 10)

b=random.randint(1, 10)

c=random.choice('+' '-' 'x' '/')

if c=='/':

a=random.randint(1, 10)*b

print(a,c,b)

count=count+1

y=int(input('Enter Your Answer:'))

if c=='+' and y==(a+b):

print('correct')

elif c=='-' and y==(a-b):

print('correct')

elif c=='x' and y==(a*b):

print('correct')

elif c=='/' and y==(a/b):

print('correct')

else:

print('wrong') break

print('Your score is', (count-1))

if time.time()-f>=10:

print("Time's up")

print('Your score is', count)

break'''
